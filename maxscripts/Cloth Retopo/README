This is very useful script for anyone trying to get better polygon smoothing on your cloth simulation. It converts your triangulated cloth plane and converts in into quads
and gives you option to point cache it.
This small tool has helped me get better smoothing everytime.
Right now this only works on plane cloth objects. 
Make sure you have not scaled the original geometry in order to make it work properly.
I am working on it in my free time to make it more robust and efficient.
